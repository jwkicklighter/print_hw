This program is a variation of the Fizz Buzz program. Numbers 1 to 100 are printed to the console on their own line. If a number is divisible by 3, the word "Hello" is printed in its place. If a number is divisible by 5, the word "World" is printed in its place. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, the number is printed.

This program must be compiled for the host OS, so a pre-compiled bytecode file is not included. To run, first make sure that you have the JDK installed on your machine (the JRE is not enough). Then run the following in the program's root directory:

javac main.java
java Main

NOTE: the compiler and runtime programs are case sensitive
